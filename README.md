# Funny-Questions-Quiz-Game


Welcome to the Fun Quiz Game, a creation brought to you with the assistance of ChatGPT! A big shout-out to ChatGPT for its invaluable contribution.

This interactive program is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring you an enjoyable quiz experience. Here's a brief overview of the steps I took to develop this engaging quiz game:

HTML Structure:
I began by creating a simple HTML file, incorporating key classes and IDs to establish connections with the CSS and JavaScript files.
The inclusion of these IDs and classes plays a crucial role in facilitating seamless integration with styling and functionality.

Enhancements with CSS:
To enhance the visual appeal and user interaction, I introduced features such as border-shadow to add a stylish border effect.
Additionally, I incorporated a delightful firework display to elevate the overall gaming experience.
I invite you to dive into the quiz game, have fun, and test your knowledge!
